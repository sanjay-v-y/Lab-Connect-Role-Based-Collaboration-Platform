MY TASKS FOR THE WEEK INCLUDED SETTING UP THE BACKEND REPOSITORY IN GIT AND LAYING THE
GROUNDWORK FOR BACKEND DEVELOPMENT. I ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN DISCUSSIONS TO DEFINE THE
PROJECT’S BACKEND SCOPE, INCLUDING CRITICAL ASPECTS LIKE USER AUTHENTICATION AND API
REQUIREMENTS. I INSTALLED NECESSARY TOOLS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTED INITIAL
SETUPS TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE TEAM’S WORKFLOW. MY CONTRIBUTIONS HELPED STREAMLINE
BACKEND TASKS AND ALIGNED THE TEAM'S EXPECTATIONS.
