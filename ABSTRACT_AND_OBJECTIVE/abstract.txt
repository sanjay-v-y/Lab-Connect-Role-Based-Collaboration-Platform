The PIC Registration and Attendance Portal with Discussion Forum is an integrated system designed to streamline student management processes while fostering collaboration and learning. This platform automates workflows such as student enrollment, lab registration, attendance tracking, and training scheduling, offering a centralized dashboard for students, faculty, administrators, and industry partners. By incorporating an interactive discussion forum akin to Quora, the system promotes knowledge sharing, technological updates, and query resolution among users.

The portal introduces distinct user roles with tailored functionalities: Admins manage student data, lab changes, training schedules, and forum moderation while generating comprehensive reports. Faculty members oversee lab enrollments, event registrations, and training schedules while participating in and moderating forum discussions. Students can select labs, register for events, track updates on their activities, and actively engage in forums. Industry partners contribute insights, share technological advancements, and participate in discussions.

The discussion forum is categorized into modules such as technological news, idea sharing, and doubt clearance. Users can create posts, comment, upvote, or downvote content, with moderation ensuring a constructive environment. Automated notifications keep users informed about forum activities.

The event registration module offers a detailed listing of events, complete with eligibility filters, descriptions, and rewards. Automated systems verify eligibility based on predefined criteria such as academic standing and skill level. Students receive notifications for registration confirmations, and outcomes of interviews or reviews are updated on their dashboards. Participation points, certificates, and awards are tracked and displayed in student profiles.

This project provides a holistic approach to managing academic activities while enabling a dynamic platform for collaboration among students, faculty, and industry, bridging the gap between education and professional insights.
