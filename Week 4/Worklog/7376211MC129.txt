I finalized the backend architecture, outlining API endpoints for core functionalities such as user
authentication, role-based access, and forum interaction. The backend framework was
initialized, and I implemented basic user authentication with token-based security. Furthermore,
I created a backend flow diagram that connected database queries with API requests to
visualize the overall process. The initial commits were pushed to Git for review.
