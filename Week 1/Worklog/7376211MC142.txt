In the first week, I worked on understanding the project scope and aligning it with the UI/UX requirements. I contributed to setting up the initial Git repository by organizing folders for design assets and documentation. Additionally, I explored various design tools, such as Figma and Adobe XD, and gathered references for wireframe creation to ensure alignment with the project goals. My role included providing input during discussions on defining user journeys and workflows to establish a strong design foundation.
