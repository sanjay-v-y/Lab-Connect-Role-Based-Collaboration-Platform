Ravivarma (Backend Development)
I provided feedback on UI/UX wireframes to ensure they were technically feasible from a
backend perspective. Additionally, I updated DFDs based on finalized wireframes, focusing on
how data would flow through the system. I explored backend frameworks, such as Flask and
Django, and began setting up an initial project environment to prepare for API development.
