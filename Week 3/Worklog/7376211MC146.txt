I reviewed the finalized wireframes to confirm that the database design met all requirements. 
The database schema was updated to include additional fields for user preferences and activity logs. 
I also created initial SQL scripts for table creation and tested them in a local environment 
to verify data relationships. All updates were committed to Git, ensuring team access.
