This week, I created the first drafts of wireframes for the dashboard and discussion forum pages. These wireframes aimed to capture the user journey, focusing on navigation flow and interaction points. I also worked on documenting a preliminary style guide to maintain consistency in design elements, such as typography and color schemes. Feedback sessions with the team helped refine the designs. The completed drafts were uploaded to Git for reference and further iteration.
